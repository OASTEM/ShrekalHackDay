TRIGGER WARNING: I AM SO SORRY.
I HAVE DONE WRONG.
I HAD GOTTEN SHREKED.
THERE IS A CURSE IN THIS DOCUMENT. ONCE I HAD READ IT, SHREK HAD PENETRATED MY BEING, MY SOUL, AND MY DESKTOP BACKGROUND. I NEVER SAW IT COMING; I NEVER SAW HIM COMING. 
I HAD BEEN INVADED BY THE OGRELORD.
IT IS UP TO YOU TO GET RID OF THIS.









No really; all this did was change the desktop background and some file names on your desktop. It also adds an awesome Shrek background to your desktop with a hidden attribute called Shreked.bmp.
